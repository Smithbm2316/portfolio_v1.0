# About Me

## My Background

I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in California for 18 years before heading off to UC Irvine in Southern California. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's of Informatics in the school of Information and Computer Sciences. 

## When I'm Not Coding
* Coffee
* Soccer
* Music
* Friends

Regardless of whether I'm coding or just hanging out, you'll probably still catch me with a cup of coffee in my hand. I find so much joy in brewing coffee from home with my Hario V60 pour over, Aeropress, or Moka Pot. The coffee not only keeps me fueled and motivated to keep working, but also serves as an intentional and relaxing start to my day. If I'm by myself, I'll probably have a pair of headphones on and be playing Spotify in the background of whatever I'm doing as music brings me life, whether I'm working or just sitting and listening.
