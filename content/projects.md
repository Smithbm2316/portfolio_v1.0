# Projects

## Dean Lipsitz Fiduciary

I began work on this project in August of 2019 when a family friend reached out to me looking for someone to build a website for him. He wanted to make his services, references, and contact information more readily available for his current and future clients. The final site was built using Wordpress so that my client would have easy access to the content if he ever wanted to update the services or references himself. 

When I began work on the project, I built the first design using just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it was a fairly simple site. Unfortunately, when I advised him which hosting services to choose for his site, I forgot to explicitly state the kind of plan that he needed to purchase. He ended up purchasing a hosting plan that already came with Wordpress installed into the hosting package. Once we realized that this would not work directly with the pre-existing site that I had created, we decided that it would be best if I migrated his content over to Wordpress so that it would be easier for him to make changes in the future without my help. 

At the point in time that we made this decision, I was unfortunately approaching several midterms that I needed to prepare for. Thankfully, my client was gracious enough to push the project off until I finished the quarter, as he was not in a rush to make the website live. I resumed work on this project in December of 2019 after I finished the academic quarter, where I was met with the challenge of whether or not I should port the design I already had over into Wordpress or start with a fresh Wordpress theme and redesign the site. After much trial and error, I decided to go with the latter option as I did not have any prior PHP experience. I finished the site in December with a fresh redesign, where it can now be seen at deanlipsitz.com.

## Healing Odyssey

I and a team of classmates modernized the desktop version of a Wordpress site for a non-profit organization (Healing Odyssey) as part of the “Project in System Software Design” course (Informatics 117) at UCI. I created high-fidelity mockups in Adobe XD and implemented the new design in their Wordpress site. We elicited requirements from the client and met with them weekly in order to ensure that deadlines and requirements were being satisfied. 

## Smash.gg Redesign

For an upper-division Informatics course I took in spring quarter of 2019, I fully redesigned Smash.gg's website along with four other teammates. We conducted interviews and surveys with the site's users in order to find out what the users liked and what pain points they had. We then brought several users in for several usability tests in order to see what tasks the users had the hardest time with, as well as conducting one cognitive walkthrough of the site. We proceeded to make a number of sketches before we finalized on designs for a few aspects of the website we wanted to change. With those final designs, we created a number of high-fidelity mockups and conducted a heuristic evaluation of those mockups in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the new designs for the site that we produced.
