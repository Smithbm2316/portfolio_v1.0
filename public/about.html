                    My Background
                </h2>

                <p class='mb-4'>
                    I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area before heading off to UC Irvine in Southern California. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics within the School of Information and Computer Sciences. My interest in software development began during the summer after my freshman year of high school where I decided to take an online introductory Java course through San Jose State University for fun. I enrolled in a Python class at my high school the following year to increase my knowledge of programming and have access to a mentor who had worked with Python for many years. From there, it wasn't until 2018 that I rekindled my love of programming. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started off my college career as a Mechanical Engineering student. However, midway through my second year I decided to switch my focus towards pursuing a degree in Informatics, as I found myself being more intrigued by software design than engineering. I began re-learning Python through UCI's intro series of programming courses, and then decided last summer to pursue web development as my future career. Through the courses that I've taken in Informatics and exploration that I have done on my own, I developed a strong passion for interface design, specifically in the world of web technologies. My main goal as a front-end developer is to successfully combine usability-focused interfaces with clean and aesthetic design.

                    When I'm Not Coding
                </h2>

                <p class='mb-4'>
                    Regardless of whether I'm coding or just hanging out, you'll probably catch me with a cup of coffee in my hand. I find so much joy in brewing coffee with my Hario V60 pour over, Aeropress, or Moka Pot. The coffee not only keeps me fueled and motivated to keep working, but also serves as an intentional and relaxing start to my day. 
                </p>
                <p class='mb-4'>
                    If I'm by myself, I'll likely be wearing a pair of headphones. I have music on in the background of most everything that I do. Music brings me life whether I'm working, relaxing, or intentionally listening. On Saturday mornings, I will be up early on my couch with a cup of coffee in hand watching Manchester United play. I grew up playing soccer, and while I don't get the opportunity to play as much anymore, I still avidly follow the English Premier League. 
                </p>

                    Since last March when COVID-19 caused all of America to go into lockdown, I have found myself also spending increasing amounts of time delving into the many different rabbit holes of software development and computers. I switched to using Linux as my daily operating system back in September of 2020, and have been learning and using the text editor Vim (specifically NeoVim) as my editor for coding, writing, and configuration of my machine. Once school wraps up and I find a full-time software development position, I plan to spend more of my free time learning about the architecture of computers, as I have been wanting to learn how to write C and Golang code for a while now, and just have not found the time. I have become much more fascinated by the command line and programs written for it, so I would love to learn more about languages that are more typically used to write such applications.

                </h2>

                <p class='mb-4'>
                    As I look toward my graduation in March of 2021 from UC Irvine, I am focused on learning as much as I possibly can about web development. In the projects that I have been blessed with the opportunity to work on, I have found so much satisfaction from seeing the joy on the faces of my clients and users once they have seen the improvements made to the interfaces that they interact with daily. I am looking for full-time work at the moment to start when I graduate, so please reach out to me if you are interested in hiring me!
