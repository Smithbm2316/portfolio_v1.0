                        I began work on this project in August of 2019 when a family friend reached out to me looking for someone to build a website for him. He wanted to make his services, references, and contact information more readily available for his current and future clients. The final site was built using Wordpress so that my client would have easy access to the content if he ever wanted to update the services or references himself. 
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        When I began work on the project, I built the first design using just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it was a fairly simple site. Unfortunately, when I advised him which hosting services to choose for his site, I forgot to explicitly state the kind of plan that he needed to purchase. He ended up purchasing a hosting plan that already came with Wordpress installed into the hosting package. Once we realized that this would not work directly with the pre-existing site that I had created, we decided that it would be best if I migrated his content over to Wordpress so that it would be easier for him to make changes in the future without my help. 
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        At the point in time that we made this decision, I was unfortunately approaching several midterms that I needed to prepare for. Thankfully, my client was gracious enough to push the project off until I finished the quarter, as he was not in a rush to make the website live. I resumed work on this project in December of 2019 after I finished the academic quarter, where I was met with the challenge of whether or not I should port the design I already had over into Wordpress or start with a fresh Wordpress theme and redesign the site. After much trial and error, I decided to go with the latter option as I did not have any prior PHP experience. I finished the site in December with a fresh redesign.
