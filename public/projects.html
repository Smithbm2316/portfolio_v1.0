                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        I began work on this project in August of 2019 when a family friend reached out to me looking for someone to build a website for him. He wanted to make his services, references, and contact information more readily available for his current and future clients. The final site was built using Wordpress so that he would have easy access to the content if he ever wanted to make changes by himself in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        When I began work on the project, I built the first design using just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it was a fairly simple site. Once the original design and implementation was completed, I advised my client about which hosting plans to choose from. However, I forgot to make the distinction between a basic shared hosting plan and a Wordpress hosting plan. As a result, my client ended up purchasing a basic Wordpress plan that came with Wordpress pre-installed into the hosting package. Once we realized that the site I had built would not be compatible with the plan that he had purchased, I decided that migrating the site to Wordpress would be the best course of action in order to make it easier for him to edit the content in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        Once we made the decision to move the site to Wordpress, I was met with the challenge of whether I should port the same exact design I already had over into Wordpress or start with a fresh Wordpress theme and redesign the site. I chose to go with the latter option as I did not have enough previous PHP experience and I wanted to make sure that we could get the website pushed live in a timely manner. After much trial and error in finding a good theme to start with, I finally settled on one and was able to redesign the website and push it live.

                        Healing Odyssey
                    </h2>

                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        During my fall quarter of 2019, I began a course at UCI called "Project in System Software Design," where I worked with a non-profit organization called Healing Odyssey to modernize the design of their website. My team and I spent our quarter in weekly meetings eliciting requirements from our client and updating them with our progress on different features or aspects of the project that they had requested us to work on. We picked up where a previous quarter's group had left off, working on the client's Wordpress site. While the previous group was able to add an e-commerce store to the client's site, they did not create a very intuitive and clean layout for that store. My teammates had to spend a large portion of the quarter fixing some of the leftover bugs and issues that the previous group had left. We also spent a few weeks trying to consolidate the large amount of pages and posts that they had into a much smaller number by building out a full sitemap of the existing site and finding ways to combine the content of multiple pages into one. Through this process, we were also able to completely overhaul the information hierarchy of their navigation structure, in order to make the site much easier to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>   
                        I spent the majority of the quarter creating prototypes and mockups of different design ideas that I had for different aspects of the interface, before finishing off the quarter implementing all of the design changes that were approved by the client. I primarily utilized paper drawings for the low-fidelity prototypes that I presented to the client, before spending a lot of my time in Adobe XD creating high-fidelity mockups and a style guide for the site to follow in order to make elements across all pages consistent and clean. After having my high-fidelity mockups approved, I went forward with implementing all of my changes into the site itself. The client was somewhat tied to the original design of their site, which was not mobile friendly at all, so I was unfortunately unable to optimize the redesign for mobile given the constraints from the client on my redesigns. However, the desktop site is live and available now.

                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        For an upper-division Informatics course I took in spring quarter of 2019, I fully redesigned Smash.gg's website along with four other teammates. We conducted interviews and surveys with the users of the site around our campus in order to find out what the users liked and what pain points they had. We then brought several users in for usability tests in order to see what tasks the users had the hardest time with, as well as conducting one cognitive walkthrough of the site. 
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        We proceeded to make a number of sketches and low-fidelity prototypes before we finalized the designs for a few aspects of the website we wanted to change. With those decisions made, we created a number of high-fidelity mockups for the account information, profile settings, registered tournaments, search, and homepage screens of the site. After finishing our final mockups in Adobe XD, we conducted a heuristic evaluation of the mockups in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the new designs for the site that we produced. Finally, we produced a case study of the all of the processes and deliverables that we completed throughout the quarter.
