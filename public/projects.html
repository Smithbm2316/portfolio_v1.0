                        Telescope is a plugin written in Lua for my main text editor (Neovim) that adds a fuzzy file finder to the editor. I have been active in this project alongside a community of other open-source developers for several weeks now. I have mainly focused on writing documentation for several features as well as contributing a few integrations for Git to the plugin myself.

                        For my capstone project at UC Irvine, my team of five produced a web-based employee management platform for a non-profit organization that hires college students to mentor kids in STEM-focused after-school programs. The application enables leaders in the organization to better manage the mentors they hire and provide them with the resources and information they need to succeed. We built the project with React.js, Next.js, a custom Node.js API, and a hosted SQL database on Azure. This was an internal project, so I unfortuantely do not have a link to the project to share. However, I would love to chat about the various challenges and barriers that my team and I overcame in the process of building this application!

                        For my final project in my "User Interaction Software" course at UCI, I built a web app using React, Next.js, and TailwindCSS that displays English Premier League data from the SportsDB API. The app allows the user to view live, past, and present scores of Premier League matches, as well as the current standings and future match schedules.

                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        After working through Wes Bos' "Beginner Javascript" course throughout my winter quarter at UCI in 2020, I wanted to build a project to cement my understanding of a few of the higher-order array methods in Javascript that are very useful: map(), filter(), and reduce(). I decided to build a small website with a couple of blog-style tutorial posts aimed at teaching new developers how each of these three methods worked in Javascript. I also decided that before I jumped into learning ReactJS, I wanted to build one more site with just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        In order to accomplish all of these things, I built and hosted a website on Netlify, integrating a dark mode toggle into a site for the first time, as well as spending a lot of time theming the project around one of my favorite visual aesthetics: synthwave (see Rob Owen's VS Code theme <a href="https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Synthwave 84'</a> if you haven't heard of synthwave before). I also took this project as an opportunity to experiment with web components, specifically Polymer's lit-html and lit-element libraries that make creating native web components much simpler. It was a fun project and in the future, I plan to migrate the three blog posts that I wrote for this project to a more permanent blog site where I can continue to write about the different tricks and concepts I continue to learn in my web development journey.

                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        I began work on this project in August of 2019 when a family friend reached out to me looking for someone to build a website for him. He wanted to make his services, references, and contact information more readily available for his current and future clients. The final site was built using Wordpress so that he would have easy access to the content if he ever wanted to make changes by himself in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        When I began work on the project, I built the first design using just plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as it was a fairly simple site. Once the original design and implementation was completed, I advised my client about which hosting plans to choose from. However, I forgot to make the distinction between a basic shared hosting plan and a Wordpress hosting plan. As a result, my client ended up purchasing a basic Wordpress plan that came with Wordpress pre-installed into the hosting package. Once we realized that the site I had built would not be compatible with the plan that he had purchased, I decided that migrating the site to Wordpress would be the best course of action in order to make it easier for him to edit the content in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        Once we made the decision to move the site to Wordpress, I was met with the challenge of whether I should port the same exact design I already had over into Wordpress or start with a fresh Wordpress theme and redesign the site. I chose to go with the latter option as I did not have enough previous PHP experience and I wanted to make sure that we could get the website pushed live in a timely manner. After much trial and error in finding a good theme to start with, I finally settled on one and was able to redesign the website and push it live.

                    <p class='mb-4'>
                        During my fall quarter of 2019, I began a course at UCI called "Project in System Software Design," where I worked with a non-profit organization called Healing Odyssey to modernize the design of their website. My team and I spent our quarter in weekly meetings eliciting requirements from our client and updating them with our progress on different features or aspects of the project that they had requested us to work on. We picked up where a previous quarter's group had left off, working on the client's Wordpress site. While the previous group was able to add an e-commerce store to the client's site, they did not create a very intuitive and clean layout for that store. My teammates had to spend a large portion of the quarter fixing some of the leftover bugs and issues that the previous group had left. We also spent a few weeks trying to consolidate the large amount of pages and posts that they had into a much smaller number by building out a full sitemap of the existing site and finding ways to combine the content of multiple pages into one. Through this process, we were also able to completely overhaul the information hierarchy of their navigation structure, in order to make the site much easier to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p class='mb-4'>   
                        I spent the majority of the quarter creating prototypes and mockups of different design ideas that I had for different aspects of the interface, before finishing off the quarter implementing all of the design changes that were approved by the client. I primarily utilized paper drawings for the low-fidelity prototypes that I presented to the client, before spending a lot of my time in Adobe XD creating high-fidelity mockups and a style guide for the site to follow in order to make elements across all pages consistent and clean. After having my high-fidelity mockups approved, I went forward with implementing all of my changes into the site itself. The client was somewhat tied to the original design of their site, which was not mobile friendly at all, so I was unfortunately unable to optimize the redesign for mobile given the constraints from the client on my redesigns. However, the desktop site is live and available now.
